          🌸 $NEW_TAG: The "Cozy" Update
          We are thrilled to announce the release of **Ani-Cli Flutter** $NEW_TAG! 🚀

          This release marks the complete transition from the terminal-based Bash script to a fully native, high-performance Desktop application built with Flutter. We've kept the powerful scraping logic you love but wrapped it in a stunning, modern, and "Cozy" interface.

          ### ✨ New Features
          
          **🎨 The "Cozy" UI Overhaul**
          *   **Live Moving Background:** A soothing, animated gradient background that slowly drifts between Cream (#FEEAC9) and Peach (#FFCDC9).
          *   **Glassmorphism:** A floating navigation dock and search bar with milky-glass effects and dynamic blurs.
          *   **Smooth Animations:** Everything flows. From the staggered entry of anime cards to the Hero transitions when clicking an image.

          **📺 Core Functionality**
          *   **Native MPV Integration:** The app now has MPV officially built-in! No need to install it manually on your system.
          *   **Smart Search:** Instant scraping of the AllAnime API to find Sub and Dub anime.
          *   **Decryption Port:** Ported the complex link decryption logic entirely to Dart for faster execution.

          **💾 Persistence (History & Favorites)**
          *   **Watch History:** Automatically tracks the episodes you watch with timestamps.
          *   **Favorites System:** "Heart" your best shows to keep them pinned in a dedicated tab.
          *   **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally using SharedPreferences—no account or login required.

          ### 🛠 Platforms Support
          *   **Windows:** Portable .exe (Tested on Windows 11 24H2).
          *   **Linux:** AppImage / Bundle (Tested on Arch Linux).
          *   **Android:** APK (Tested on SDK 30).
          *   **macOS / iOS:** Supported (Untested - Developer is poor 💸).

          ### 📝 Changelog
          $CHANGELOG

          ### 🤝 Credits
          Based on the scraping logic of ani-cli.
          Ported and designed by minhmc2007.
